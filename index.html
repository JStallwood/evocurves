                        <p>A Bézier curve is a type of parametric curve which has many practical applications, including robotics. The Bézier curve is constructed by taking a weighted combination of these <b>control points</b>.</p>

                        <p>Let \(S_{h} \subseteq D\) be the set of all good things that are close enough to the solution's Bézier curve to count as being passed through.

                        <p class="c4 center">\(S_{h} = \{\boldsymbol{d} \in D \mid \exists t \in [0, 1] : ||\boldsymbol{d} - \boldsymbol{B}(t)|| \le r\}\)</p>

                        <p>The fitness of a solution, \(\phi: H \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\), can be given as:</p>

                       <p>In small teams or by yourself, you will represent a hypothesis of inner control points; the two outer control points will be fixed. Your hypothesis will be an ordered collection of 2-dimensional points, \(h = (\boldsymbol{P}_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{2} \mid 1 \le i \le 5)\).</p>
                       <p><b>You'll have something like this written down: \(\boldsymbol{P}_{1} = (x_{1}, y_{1}), \boldsymbol{P}_{2} = (x_{2}, y_{2}), \dots\)</b>.</p>
                       <p>Find another team or person and make offspring hypotheses. You can do this by:</p>
                       <ul>
                        <li>Using some of your control points and some of theirs in an order of your choice.</li>
                        <li>Mixing the control point vector components.</li>
                        <li>If one of you has more control points than the other, flip a coin. If you win, make the offspring have as many control points as your hypothesis. If they win, make the offspring have as many control points as their hypothesis.</li>

                       <p>After you've made an offspring flip a coin 5 times. If it comes up heads at least 4 times, then flip a coin again. On a head, add a new control point to the offspring with random values (between 0 and 800). On a tail remove one of the control points from the offpring. You should never have more than 7 or fewer than 1 inner control points.</p>
                       <p>Keep track of your original hypothesis and all the offspring you create and calculate their fitness scores.</p>
